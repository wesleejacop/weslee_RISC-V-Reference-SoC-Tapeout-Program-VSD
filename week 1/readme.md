# Day 1: Kickoff to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis Journey

Welcome to the first day of my RTL design workshop! Today marked the start of my exploration into digital circuit design, where I dove into Verilog coding, simulated my circuits with the open-source tool **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and took the initial steps into logic synthesis using **Yosys**. This report captures all my hands-on labs, crucial insights, and the practical knowledge I gained building a foundation in RTL design.

## 1. My Learning Highlights: Simulator, Design Logic, and Testbenches

### ðŸš€ Simulator Insight  
I came to understand that a **simulator** acts like a virtual environment where digital circuits can be tested by feeding inputs and observing outputs before physical implementation. This step is vital to catch logical bugs early.

### ðŸ’¡ What is Design?  
My **design** is essentially the Verilog code that describes the logical behavior of the circuit â€” in essence, writing down what the circuit *should* do.

### ðŸ§ª Testbench Essentials  
I deepened my understanding of the **testbench**, which creates a simulation environment to apply various scenarios to my design and check for correct behavior.

## 2. Getting Up and Running with Icarus Verilog

Icarus Verilog, or **iverilog**, is the open-source tool I used to compile and simulate my Verilog code. The workflow I followed was:
