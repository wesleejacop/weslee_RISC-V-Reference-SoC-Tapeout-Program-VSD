# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

Welcome to my **Day 1** RTL Workshop report!  
Today, I embarked on my journey into digital design by learning Verilog, open-source simulation with **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and the basics of logic synthesis using **Yosys**. This report documents my practical labs, key learnings, and hands-on experiences as I built a strong foundation in RTL design.
